# Advanced Verilog Design Modules

This project includes sequence detectors using Moore and Mealy FSMs, synchronous serial circuits, and counters, written in Verilog.

## Included Modules
✅ 110 Sequence Detector (Moore and Mealy models)  
✅ Serial Adder and Serial Multiplier  
✅ Johnson Counter and Ring Counter  

## Features
- Demonstrates FSM-based sequence detection  
- Implements synchronous serial arithmetic circuits  
- Provides counters for sequential logic design  
- Includes testbenches for simulation  

## Tools
- Supports simulation with Icarus Verilog, ModelSim, Vivado  

## Author
Designed for academic learning and Verilog HDL practice.
